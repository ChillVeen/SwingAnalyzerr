## 🔧 Configuration

### ML Model Setup
The app includes a pre-trained Core ML model (`golftrain.mlmodel`) for swing analysis. To update or retrain:

1. Prepare training data in the required format
2. Use Create ML or external tools to train your model
3. Replace the model file in the project
4. Update the `MLSwingAnalyzer` class accordingly

### Core Data Schema
The app uses Core Data for persistence with the following entities:
- **SwingSession**: Main swing record
- **SwingAnalysis**: ML analysis results
- **SensorReading**: Raw motion data

### Watch Connectivity
Sync configuration in `WatchConnectivityManager`:
- Message types for different data
- Transfer methods (immediate vs. queued)
- Error handling and retry logic

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
xcodebuild test -scheme SwingAnalyzer -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Device Testing
1. **Apple Watch Required**: Motion sensors only work on physical devices
2. **Pairing**: Ensure watch is properly paired and connected
3. **Permissions**: Grant motion and fitness permissions when prompted

### Debug Features
